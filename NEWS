Changes in Version 0.1-1

  o First CRAN release of new "psychomix" package for fitting
    psychometric mixture models based on flexmix infrastructure. At the
    moment only Rasch mixture models are implemented in various flavors:
    with/without concomitant variables, different parametrizations
    of the score distribution (saturated vs. mean/variance specification).
    See vignette("raschmix", package = "psychomix") for details.
