Changes in Version 1.1-0

  o Improved functionality for raschmix() to allow for differences 
    between components in terms of identified parameters.

  o Improved function raschmix() to leverage new functionality from 
    the flexmix package: Parameter estimates from the previous M-step 
    can now be used for initialization.

  o Function raschmix() can now model the score distribution to be 
    equal across all components (for both a "saturated" and a "meanvar" 
    specification of the score model).


Changes in Version 1.0-0

  o Official first stable release of the raschmix() functionality in the
    package, accompanying the manuscript "Flexible Rasch Mixture Models
    with Package psychomix" by Frick, Strobl, Leisch, and Zeileis,
    published in the Journal of Statistical Software 48(7). See
    citation("psychomix") for details.


Changes in Version 0.2-1

  o For increased numerical stability the default minprior control
    parameter in raschmix() is now 0.05 (as in flexmix) and not 0
    (as in the previous psychomix version).

  o Revised vignette("raschmix", package = "psychomix"). Specifically,
    there is a discussion of how the FLXMCrasch() can be used directly
    with flexmix() or stepFlexmix() from the "flexmix" package.

  o Improved function simRaschmix() to allow for a flexible specification
    of the data generating process. 
    
  o Added an effectsplot() function that leverages the "effects" package
    for visualizing the effects of the concomitant variables (if any) in
    the mixture model. This has not yet been fully tested and may change
    in future versions.
    
  o Added a new function btmix() for Bradley-Terry mixture models. The
    design follows that of raschmix() rather closely. Based on btReg.fit()
    from package "psychotools", there is a flexmix driver called FLXMCbtreg().
    The btmix() function is a convenience interface calling stepFlexmix()
    with the FLXMCbtreg() driver. This has not yet been fully tested and
    may change in future versions.


Changes in Version 0.1-1

  o First CRAN release of new "psychomix" package for fitting
    psychometric mixture models based on flexmix infrastructure. At the
    moment only Rasch mixture models are implemented in various flavors:
    with/without concomitant variables, different parametrizations
    of the score distribution (saturated vs. mean/variance specification).
    See vignette("raschmix", package = "psychomix") for details.
